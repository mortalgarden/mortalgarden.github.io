                            This report follows an email from Harriet (hpw332@mailpod.com) to 
                        someone named ‘Darla’ (dwinny@mailpod.com), who can be assumed to 
                        be her family member due to sharing surnames. Harriet had been speaking 
                        with a consultant (most likely a grief consultant), whose name was never 
                        mentioned, as she was mourning the loss of Arthur, her late partner of 
                        20 years. The consultant told Harriet to go to Grantham Cemetery over 
                        the phone one night; She mentions how he sounded excited in an 
                        off-putting way on that phone call, which was unlike him. At the 
                        cemetery, instead of the consultant, she finds ‘Arthur’; A discolored, 
                        mismatched, undead version of Arthur. It sounded just like Arthur, and 
                        it recognized Harriet. When asked, it responded that it was ‘some of’ 
                        Arthur. She runs, and doesn’t get followed. Harriet asks Darla if she’s 
                        free, as she’s afraid of staying at her home due to her newfound fear 
                        of Arthur.

                            in and suggests, instead, to file it under ‘Reanimation, partial’ and 
                            cross-link it with ‘regret.’ She also adds that it could fall under 
                            ‘Amalgamative, semi.’ Sam goes with Gwen’s first suggestion, which Alice
