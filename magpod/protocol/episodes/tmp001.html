                    This report follows an email from Harriet (hpw332@mailpod.com) to 
                    someone named ‘Darla’ (dwinny@mailpod.com), who can be assumed to 
                    be her family member due to sharing surnames. Harriet had been speaking 
                    with a consultant (most likely a grief consultant), whose name was never 
                    mentioned, as she was mourning the loss of Arthur, her late partner of 
                    20 years. The consultant told Harriet to go to Grantham Cemetery over 
                    the phone one night; She mentions how he sounded excited in an 
                    off-putting way on that phone call, which was unlike him. At the 
                    cemetery, instead of the consultant, she finds ‘Arthur’; A discolored, 
                    mismatched, undead version of Arthur. It sounded just like Arthur, and 
                    it recognized Harriet. When asked, it responded that it was ‘some of’ 
                    Arthur. She runs, and doesn’t get followed. Harriet asks Darla if she’s 
                    free, as she’s afraid of staying at her home due to her newfound fear 
                    of Arthur.

                    are within the suddenly off-putting behavior of the consultant, 
                    ‘Arthur’s features being mismatched, mentions of his shape being ‘wrong’, 
                    something having potentially been pressing against his skin from the 
                    inside, and ‘Arthur’ saying “Some of him.” in response to Harriet.

                    Sam was planning on filing it under ‘Zombies,’ to which Alice was going to 
                    let him do, as she believes nobody reads the reports they file. Gwen steps 
                    in and suggests, instead, to file it under ‘Reanimation, partial’ and 
                    cross-link it with ‘regret.’ She also adds that it could fall under 
                    ‘Amalgamative, semi.’ Sam goes with Gwen’s first suggestion, which Alice 
                    doesn’t exactly like.
