                    This report follows an email from <b>Harriet</b> (<i>hpw332@mailpod.com</i>) to 
                    someone named <b>‘Darla’</b> (<i>dwinny@mailpod.com</i>), who can be assumed to 
                    be her family member due to them sharing surnames. Harriet had been speaking 
                    with a consultant (most likely a <b>grief consultant</b>), whose name was never 
                    mentioned, as she was <b>mourning the loss</b> of Arthur, her <b>late partner of 
                    20 years.</b> The consultant told Harriet to go to <b>Grantham Cemetery</b> over 
                    the phone one night; She mentions how he sounded <b>excited in an 
                    off-putting way</b> on that phone call, which was unlike him. At the 
                    cemetery, instead of the consultant, she finds ‘Arthur’; <b>A discolored, 
                    mismatched, undead version of Arthur.</b> Despite this, it <i>sounded</i> just like Arthur, and 
                    it <i>recognized</i> Harriet. When asked, <b>it responded that it was ‘some of’ 
                    Arthur.</b> She runs, and doesn’t get followed. Harriet asks Darla if she’s 
                    free, as she’s afraid of staying at her home due to her newfound fear 
                    of Arthur.

                    This one follows an online forum (<i>forums.lostcityurbex.com</i>) 
                    for spelunking and old sites. A user going by <b>RedCanary</b> started a new topic on 
                    <b>The Magnus Institute ruins,</b> asking about its status; It’s said to be <i>fully 
                    explored,</i> however there’s <i>no online information on the site,</i> thus 
                    RedCanary wants to know if exploring it is worth it. Another user, BadGrav31, says to go for it, 
                    as the lack of information online is good enough reason to check it out oneself. 
                    A moderator for the forum, ArcherK, says it was on the ‘cleared’ list as that’s what 
                    one of Devan's (<i>whom I assume is a 
                    former forum admin/mod</i>) old lists had it placed under; <b>ArcherK assumes this was a 
                    mistake on Devan’s part.</b> RedCanary decides they’ll check it out, and they’ll report 
                    their findings on their return.
                </p>
                <p class="analysis">
                    Once they return from their exploration, RedCanary makes a post where they say it’s 
                    <b>definitely 
                    not cleared</b> and that they’ll make their full report the following day. 
                    A user named FlowersUnderground joins the topic thread,
                    <b>asking about pictures of the ruins,</b> to which RedCanary says <b>they’re having trouble 
                    with uploading the 
                    files due to photographic distortion.</b> They also mention their <b>increasing paranoia.</b>
                </p>
                <p class="analysis">
                    They detail some of their findings, one of which being some <b>odd graffiti,</b> 
                    most being <b>strange symbols;</b> RedCanary mentions the symbols potentially 
                    being <b>of the occult.</b> BadGrav31 expresses curiosity about these graffiti, 
                    and asks if it’s possible to get pictures. RedCanary responds that the photos from 
                    their exploration are more than likely gone, due to the corrupted files; they then 
                    mention <b>a strange, wooden box, they found, as well.</b> The box contains some of 
                    the aforementioned symbols; Though, they couldn’t post images of this as well, <b>due 
                    to the same photographic distortion issues.</b> <b><i>They once again mention their 
                    increasing paranoia.</i></b> ArcherK says to RedCanary that the forum <b>does not 
                    endorse theft from exploration sites,</b> and that RedCanary better not be 
                    admitting to taking souvenirs. RedCanary lashes out, saying they don’t 
                    need anonymous DMs, <b>which ArcherK explicitly mentions the forum doesn’t allow,</b> 
                    calling them a thief; They also threaten that they know how to dox people, 
                    too, if needed. <b>This sudden aggression is likely attributed to RedCanary’s 
                    growing paranoia</b> — this outburst does, however, lead to RedCanary getting 
                    a <b>formal warning</b> for breaking the rules.

                    A week later, BadGrav31 posts in the forum topic that they’re still waiting 
                    on the graffiti pictures if they’re retrievable. There’s a post from RedCanary 
                    with a now-removed image of somebody's eyes, <i>potentially after being gouged out,</i>

                    She introduces him to Freddy (<i>FR3–d1</i>), the software their system is 
                    based upon, running on a business-focused predecessor to Windows 95 
                    (<i>Windows NT 4.0</i>). She goes into the first case file, which is an email, 
                    much like CAT1RBC5257-12052022-09012024, though with different contents. 
                    This one was filed as CAT2RC1157-12052022-09012024, which was filed under 
                    Dolls, watching”. She says Sam can try filing the next case on his own, 
                     is the aforementioned CAT1RBC5257-12052022-09012024, that NORRIS reads out. 
                     Gwen gets called into Lena’s office for the sole purpose of being scolded 
                     for disrespecting Lena in front of the others, especially the new hire (<i>Sam</i>) 
                     during Teddy’s leaving party, amongst other unimportant details.

                    Colin and Sam talk for the first time, where Alice set Sam up to 
                    be yelled at by Colin. Sam apologizes profusely. Back at their 
                    workstations, Gwen and Sam talk a bit before being interrupted by 
                    CHESTER with case CAT23RAB2155-10042022-09012024, about the Institute. 
                    After the things covered in the section for that report, Gwen complains at 
                    Alice’s need to name the voices. Alice offers to take Sam out to the pub, 
                    already worried for how he’s taking the reports in, where they reminisce over 
                    the past and Sam thanks Alice for her help getting him this job.
