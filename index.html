    see <a href="/magpod/home.html">here</a> for very <br>
    autism-driven documentation on <b>the magnus archives</b> <br>
    and <b>the magnus protocol.</b> this is mostly for me <br>
    (i don't like how google docs are but i wanted to <br>
    do this somewhere, so i'm taking advantage of this <br>
    github feature) but you're free to see it!
